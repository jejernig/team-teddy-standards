## Documentation Requirements

### Accessibility Documentation

## Communication Guidelines

### NEVER claim accessibility compliance without:
- Explicit confirmation that ALL automated accessibility tests are passing
- Evidence of manual accessibility testing results
- Verification of WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance
- Documentation of screen reader and keyboard testing
- Confirmation of accessibility testing coverage

### Instead of saying "accessible" or "WCAG compliant," use specific language:
- "Automated accessibility tests passing but requires [manual testing] before production"
- "WCAG 2.2 Level A compliant but needs [Level AA validation] for production"
- "Screen reader compatible but requires [keyboard navigation testing] validation"
- "Accessibility baseline met but needs [user testing with disabilities] before production"
- "A11y tools passing but requires [accessibility audit] for full compliance"

## Key Accessibility Principles

- Accessibility is designed in from the start, not retrofitted
- All accessibility features must be tested with actual assistive technologies
- Automated testing catches ~30% of issues; manual testing is essential
- Users with disabilities should be involved in testing when possible
- Accessibility benefits everyone, not just users with disabilities
- Legal compliance is the minimum standard, not the goal
- Accessibility is an ongoing process, not a one-time checklist
- Performance and accessibility must be balanced, not traded off
- Inclusive design creates better experiences for all users
- Accessibility documentation helps users discover and use features
