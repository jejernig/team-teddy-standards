# Testing Standards

## Test Execution Requirements

**MANDATORY**: ALL unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests MUST pass before any production readiness claims.

### Test Suite Status
- **100% pass rate** on all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests is MANDATORY
- Test execution results must be verified and documented
- No production readiness claims without explicit test confirmation

## Unit Testing Standards

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Line Coverage**: Target 70-80% code coverage for all business logic (diminishing returns beyond this)
- **Branch Coverage**: Target 70%+, ideally 80-90% (ensures all decision paths are tested)
- **Code Complexity**: Cyclomatic Complexity must be <10 per function/method (ideal range 1-5)
- **CRAP Score**: Change Risk Anti-Patterns (CRAP) score must be <15 per method (<10 is excellent)
  - Formula: `CRAP = CC¬≤ √ó (1 - Coverage%)¬≥ + CC`
  - CRAP > 30 is considered dangerous and requires immediate refactoring

### Test Quality Requirements
Each function/method must have tests for:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Input validation and boundary conditions
- Null/undefined/empty value handling

### Test Implementation Standards
- **Test Isolation**: Tests must be independent and not rely on external dependencies
- **Mock Usage**: External services, databases, and APIs must be properly mocked

## Integration Testing Standards

### API Testing Requirements
- **API Endpoint Coverage**: ‚â• 90% of public REST/GraphQL endpoints tested
- **Input Validation**: Typical scenarios + edge cases + boundary conditions tested
- **Response Validation**: Status codes + schema validation for all endpoints
- **Authentication Coverage**: All auth paths (login/refresh/expiry) + RBAC for all endpoints

### Database Testing Requirements
- **Database Operations**: All major CRUD operations tested with real database connections
- **Referential Integrity**: Database constraints and relationships validated
- **Data Rollback**: 100% test cleanup with proper rollback on failures

### Service Integration Requirements
- **Service Communication**: All downstream service calls tested (with appropriate mocking)
- **Error Handling**: Network failures, timeouts, and 3rd party service downtime scenarios
- **Performance**: P99 response time ‚â§ 500ms per endpoint (adjust based on SLA)
- **Test Suite Duration**: ‚â§ 5 minutes for full integration test suite
- **Integration Test Coverage**: 60-80% code coverage from integration tests alone

## End-to-End Testing Standards (Playwright)

### Framework Requirements
- **Framework**: Use Playwright for all E2E testing with Playwright MCP integration
- **Test Pass Rate**: ‚â• 95% for stable releases; 100% in protected branches
- **Flaky Test Rate**: < 2% (flaky = sometimes pass/fail with no code change)
- **Test Duration**: ‚â§ 30 seconds per test; total suite ‚â§ 5-10 minutes
- **Retry Usage**: < 5% of tests requiring retries (> 10% indicates environment instability)

### Coverage and Organization
- **Test Coverage**: ‚â• 80% line/branch coverage combining unit and E2E coverage
- **Test Organization**: Proper tagging with `@smoke`, `@critical`, `@a11y`, `@regression`
- **User Journey Coverage**: All documented user flows must have corresponding E2E tests

### Technical Requirements
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Tests run on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track page load times, Core Web Vitals, and network requests
- **Visual Regression**: Screenshot comparisons for UI consistency
- **Accessibility**: Automated a11y testing with axe-playwright integration
- **Test Isolation**: Each test runs in isolated browser context with proper cleanup

## Test Environment Requirements

### Infrastructure Standards
- **Test Data**: Proper test fixtures and seed data for consistent testing
- **Environment Isolation**: Tests run in isolated environments without affecting production
- **CI/CD Integration**: All tests must pass in continuous integration pipeline
- **Playwright Configuration**: Proper playwright.config.js with browser matrix and retry logic
- **Test Reporting**: Clear test results with failure details, coverage reports, and Playwright HTML reports
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests can run concurrently without conflicts
- **Playwright MCP**: Leverage Playwright MCP for enhanced test automation and debugging capabilities

## Key Testing Principles

- High branch coverage with meaningful assertions > high line coverage with weak tests
- CRAP score combines complexity and coverage to identify truly risky code
- Methods with Cyclomatic Complexity > 15 should be broken into smaller functions
- Focus testing efforts on business-critical and complex logic rather than chasing 100% coverage
- Flaky tests indicate environmental issues or race conditions that must be resolved
- E2E tests should use proper tagging (@smoke, @critical, @a11y, @regression) for targeted testing
- Integration tests must use real databases/services, not mocks, for true integration validation
- API contract testing ensures proper request/response handling and schema compliance
- Performance thresholds must align with defined SLAs and user experience requirements

## Communication Guidelines

### NEVER claim production readiness without:
- Explicit confirmation that ALL tests (unit/integration/e2e) are passing
- Evidence of test execution results
- Verification of test coverage adequacy
- Confirmation that quality metrics meet defined thresholds

### Instead of saying "production ready," use specific language:
- "Ready for staging deployment with [specific caveats]"
- "Requires [specific improvements] before production use"
- "MVP implementation - needs [security/performance/testing] hardening"
- "Functional but requires production-grade [error handling/monitoring/etc.]"
- "Tests passing but needs [specific area] verification before production"
