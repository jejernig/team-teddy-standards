## Communication Guidelines

### NEVER claim production readiness without:
- Explicit confirmation that ALL security scans are passing
- Evidence of vulnerability assessment results
- Verification of OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Confirmation of SOC 2 control implementation
- Documentation of security testing coverage

### Instead of saying "secure" or "production ready," use specific language:
- "Security scans passing but requires [specific security review] before production"
- "OWASP compliant but needs [penetration testing/security audit] validation"
- "Dependency vulnerabilities resolved but requires [manual security review]"
- "Security controls implemented but needs [compliance verification] before production"
- "Meets security baseline but requires [SOC 2 audit/security assessment] for production"

## Key Security Principles

- Security is integrated throughout the development lifecycle, not added at the end
- All security controls must be tested and verified, not just implemented
- Security findings must be resolved before production deployment
- Compliance requirements are minimum standards, not maximum security
- Security monitoring and incident response are ongoing operational requirements
- Regular security assessments and updates are mandatory, not optional
- Defense in depth requires multiple layers of security controls
- Security by design ensures secure defaults and fail-safe mechanisms
